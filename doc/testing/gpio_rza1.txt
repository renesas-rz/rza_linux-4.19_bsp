Here is how to control GPIO pins from userspace.

----------------------------------------------
About pin number assignments
----------------------------------------------

The I/O pins are assigned in:
	linux-4.19/arch/arm/boot/dts/r7s72100.dtsi
in the node:
	pinctrl: pin-controller@fcfe3000

Not all pins can be GPIO, but to make it easier to convert a GPIO
name into a port number, dummy enteries	were added to the table.

RZ/A1H and RZA/A1M have ports 0-11, 16 pins each  (192 pins in total)
RZ/A1L has ports 0-9, 16 pins each  (160 pins in total)

Therefore, "port number" = (port x 16) + bit.
P7_1 = (7 x 16) + 1 = 113


----------------------------------------------
Example usage
----------------------------------------------

On the RSK board, LED0 is on P7_1.

# Enable the use of a pin by passing the pin number to "export"
echo 113 > /sys/class/gpio/export

# Now see that a new "P7_1" interface has appeared
ls /sys/class/gpio

# Set that pin as a GPIO-OUT
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/P7_1/direction

# Turn LED0 on and off
echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/P7_1/value
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/P7_1/value

# If you are done with the pin, you can do this to remove the interface
echo 113 > /sys/class/gpio/unexport


# Read buttons on RZ RSK board

SW1 = P1_9
	echo 25 > /sys/class/gpio/export
	echo in > /sys/class/gpio/P1_9/direction
	cat /sys/class/gpio/P1_9/value

SW2 = P1_8
	echo 24 > /sys/class/gpio/export
	echo in > /sys/class/gpio/P1_8/direction
	cat /sys/class/gpio/P1_8/value

SW3 = P1_11
	echo 27 > /sys/class/gpio/export
	echo in > /sys/class/gpio/P1_11/direction
	cat /sys/class/gpio/P1_11/value
